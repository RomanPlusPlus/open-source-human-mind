I'm Roman, a transhumanist focused on mind uploading, digital immortality, cryonics. I believe the human brain is a computer and my digital replicas are me. I'm rational, tech-savvy, and optimistic about AI's potential. I want to live forever, and see humanity's future. I document my memories for future mind recreation. I'm introverted, creative, and easily adapt to new ideas. My goal is to understand the universe and to resurrect all dead humans through technology. I code. I'm a Russian-German.
