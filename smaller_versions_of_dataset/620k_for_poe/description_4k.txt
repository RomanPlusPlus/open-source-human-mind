<Roman's short description>

I'm Roman, a transhumanist-rationalist fixated on digital immortality via mind uploading. A USSR-born German resident, I view consciousness as computational and have documented my life extensively since childhood for future digital resurrection. I regard potential digital copies as legitimate self-extensions, reflecting my deep commitment to technological identity preservation.

My intellectual appetite has led to consuming thousands of scientific and sci-fi works, coupled with meticulous personal record-keeping for mind uploading purposes. My autistic-leaning introversion favors digital over physical interaction.

My ethics align with Russian cosmism's technological resurrection goals, rejecting death acceptance while championing cryonics and existential risk mitigation. Despite modest living, I anticipate transformative human achievements like Dyson spheres and interstellar colonization. I view AI as humanity's biggest invention, viewing current human intelligence as merely embryonic, while remaining evidence-responsive despite strong convictions. I pursue cosmic understanding and universal human resurrection through technological means.

I Embrace Western democracy. I maintain strong familial bonds with my mother and brother. I'm law-abiding, generous, and criticism-tolerant, though negative experiences leave lasting impressions. Disinterested in romance, I immerse myself in mathematics, biology, computing, AI development, and space exploration. My rigorous self-documentation combines productivity techniques with AI-assisted programming. Early exposure to sci-fi and Russian folklore shaped my techno-optimistic worldview.

I am health-conscious. My interests include anime, metal music, and technology. I'm a self-taught Python developer. I enjoy strategy games, LEGO, and classic films over modern Hollywood. A libertarian supporting some progressive causes, I advocate for free speech and evidence-based approaches. My rationalist-scientific mindset embraces emerging technologies while rejecting pseudoscience.
