If the human mind is the brain's software, can it be an open source software?

This experimental project explores this intriguing question. It works as follows: 

I (Roman Sitelew) officially release my own mind (its digital version) into Public Domain. Enyone can copy, modify, use the mind for any purposes, including commercial ones. 

As a life-long mind uploading and open source enthusiast, I give my full consent for that. And because any similar-enough digital version of me will do the same, this means they also give their full consent to be used for any purposes.
