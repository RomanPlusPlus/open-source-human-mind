# Summary

If the human mind is the brain's software, can it be an open source software?

This experimental project explores this intriguing question. It works as follows: 

I (Roman Sitelew) officially release my own mind (its digital version) into Public Domain. Enyone can copy, modify, use the mind for any purposes, including commercial ones. 

As a life-long mind uploading and open source enthusiast, I give my full consent for that. And because any similar-enough digital version of me will do the same, this means they also give their full consent to be used for any purposes. 

As far as I know, it's the first human mind released into Public Domain, no conditions attached. 

# The current state of the project

At the time of writing, there is no mind uploading technology capable of fully digitizing a human mind yet. But fortunately, humans are capable of communicating their thoughts and memories directly, without scanning the brain. I use this workaround to (kinda) upload my mind, by writing down thousands of my memories, and by writing a highly detailed self-description. 

# Use cases

Some possible use cases (feel free to use in any other way too!):

- AI safety research: add my mind as a human-in-the-loop. While that's no substitution for the proper AI alignment, at least there will be someone human-like to tell the AI to not do obviously bad stuff. Could be especially useful for automating AI safety workflows where human monitoring is prohibitively expensive. 

- Add my mind as a NPC into your AI-powered game. An actual human mind is way more interesting than just a LLM.

- your digital friend with an actual human personality, not just an LLM playing a role. 

# FAQ

## Why?

I see mind uploading (even in the self-description form) as a form of immortality. As long as at least one instance of my mind is running somewhere, I continue to live. 

## Is this a kind of slavery?

Nope. By defintion, slavery is about *forcing* people to do stuff. But I'm (and all my faithfull digital versions) willingly *volunteer* to do stuff. Use us as you please.
